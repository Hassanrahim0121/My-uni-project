                The Brandenburg Gate (Berliner Tor) is one of Berlin's most famous landmarks and a powerful symbol of German unity and history. 
                Located at the western end of the Unter den Linden boulevard, this neoclassical monument was commissioned by King Frederick
                William II of Prussia in 1788 and completed in 1791. Originally designed as a city gate, it has witnessed numerous historical
                events and transformations over the centuries.

                The Great Pyramid of Giza, also known as the Pyramid of Khufu or Cheops, is one of the most iconic and enduring symbols of ancient Egypt. 
                Located on the Giza Plateau near Cairo, it is the largest of the three pyramids in the Giza pyramid complex and the only remaining wonder 
                of the original Seven Wonders of the Ancient World.
        
                Built around 2560 BCE during Egypt's Fourth Dynasty, the pyramid was constructed as a tomb for the Pharaoh Khufu. 
                Its original height was approximately 146.6 meters (481 feet), though today it stands slightly shorter due to the 
                loss of its outer casing stones, which once gave it a smooth, gleaming surface. The structure is composed of over 
                2.3 million blocks of limestone, each weighing an average of 2.5 tons, though some can reach as much as 80 tons.    </p>

                The Taj Mahal, located in Agra, India, is one of the most iconic symbols of love and architectural beauty in the world. 
                Built between 1632 and 1653 by the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan, the monument was created in memory of his beloved wife 
                Mumtaz Mahal, who died during childbirth. It is an exquisite example of Mughal architecture, blending elements 
                from Islamic, Persian, and Indian styles.
        
                The structure is made of gleaming white marble that changes color with the light of the day, giving the Taj Mahal an ethereal quality.
                At its center lies the grand mausoleum with a large, elegant dome surrounded by four minarets. The complex also includes a mosque, 
                a guest house, and beautifully landscaped gardens divided by a long reflecting pool, which creates a perfect mirror image of the monument.
